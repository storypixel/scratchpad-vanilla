# scratchpad-vanilla
My starting point for a new animation quick proof of concept. Evolves over time.

# Installation
* Clone _your_ version into some directory on your machine
* optionally: run ```rm -rf .git``` iff you want to dissociate from this repo
* run ```bower install``` in that directory
* run ```npm install``` in that directory
* run ```gulp```

# Always branch
To start a new experiment, just do
```git checkout -b some-animation-branch```

Do your experiments and post your branches, when you are ready for another experiment just start another branch.
